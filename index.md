## Introduction
Social media doesn’t control us, right? It doesn’t influence how we think? How we spend our time? What we do in our free time? Surely not…

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes in various aspects of human life, with social media emerging as a prominent platform for communication and information exchange. Over the course of the pandemic, social media had a huge influence over us and our decisions. The average time spent on social media by American users significantly increased from 54 minutes and 56 minutes in the previous years to 65 minutes daily in 2020. It’s predicted that in the next years, there will likely be no substantial shifts in the amount of time spent on social networking, and that numbers will stay stable. (Statista, 2023). The image above links to the predominant theme of social media holding so much power that it is becoming overwhelming and controlling, in terms of how we think, as well as taking over our lives so much it begins to impact our sleep schedules and internal thought processes. 

Covid-19 has had both a detrimental short-term and long-term impact on every individual on the planet; however, the magnitude of the effects have obviously differed from person to person. Different peoples’ presence on digital platforms may have varied over the course of the pandemic. It could have become more prevalent in some cases, or could have declined drastically. Either way, personality types and character traits must have had an influence over certain coping mechanisms and the way people chose to live in lockdown and this article is going to explore that idea further.

This essay delves into the psychological impacts of the pandemic on social media usage; specifically examining how different personality types responded to and engaged with social media during these challenging times. Social media platforms have become essential tools for communication, information dissemination, and social connection – and this was especially heightened during the pandemic, and how the role of personality types shaped individuals' online behaviours.
