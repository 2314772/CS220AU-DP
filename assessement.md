## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: 

| Criterion | 40- | 40+ | 50+ | 60+ | 70+ | 
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1.1       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 1.2       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 2.1       |     |     |     |     |  o  |
| 2.2       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 3.1       |     |     |     |  o  |     |

I think I have effectively communicated my messages relating to the existential risk of COVID-19, personality types, and the influence these have on our digital identity, mental health and online presence. I used multiple visual aids to entice the reader, as well as support the points I was making. For example, bar graphs with data from studies I have spoken about. I opened with a hooking set of questions to create a starting point for the reader to think about for themselves. I also finished with a question-provoking statement for the reader – and so creating a cyclical structure. 

I spent a lot of time researching my topic and finding research articles and academic papers to support my thesis statement; I think this is quite evident as my log demonstrates a clear commitment to this project and a consistency too. Following further guidance, I went back to my portfolio to refine my assignment and make any necessary adjustment. On the index file I sorted out all my references so that they were all in the same formatting and style (APA 7th). I also went back over my article to check spelling and grammar, and made minor tweaks (ie. covid-19 to COVID-19). Overall, I think it is a relatively good essay focusing on the relationship and connections between COVID-19 and individuals’ digital identities, and going into depth surrounding my research question. 

## Peer-assessment
Another student in my group provided feedback on my work as follows: 

| Criterion | 40- | 40+ | 50+ | 60+ | 70+ | 
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1.1       |     |     |     |     |  o  |
| 1.2       |     |     |     |     |  o  |
| 2.1       |     |     |     |     |  o  |
| 2.2       |     |     |     |     |  o  |
| 3.1       |     |     |     |     |  o  |

This article has great usage of real-world data, and the content is highly relevant. The website’s structure is very clear, and effective communication of ideas and focus of each section helps follow the logical flow. It has an excellent overall view; it’s nice that a lot of images were used, and graphs make it easier to follow the information given. There are a good amount of references to back up points. And the last sentence of this work makes a good ending. 
It could benefit from a bit more elaboration on the topic of personality types and their connection to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And I saw that it might be good to change the reference format (digital identities paragraph): David White (White & Le Cornu, 2017) - it’s better to use both names before brackets and only the year in them.
And in references: change places of Worldometer and Van Hoof papers.
Overall, it is a well-researched and thoughtful essay. With some refinement in the introduction, grammar, and visual aids, the work could be even more impactful.
